# GML2DSkeletalAnimation

This project for Gamemaker Studio 2 contains a diverse range of useful scripts for importing and manipulating skeletal animation sprites at runtime.

## Downloads

Download the project file ([.zip](https://github.com/NuxiiGit/GML2DSkeletalAnimation/archive/master.zip)), or clone the project through git using:

```
git clone git@github.com:NuxiiGit/GML2DSkeletalAnimation.git
```

### Supported Software

```
- Spine
- DragonBones
- Spriter
```

Alternatively, due to the decentralised nature of the runtime, you can use the features I offer without the use of external software by dynamically creating bones and other skeleton data at runtime without the need for an armature or texture atlas.
