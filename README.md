# 2DSKAnimation

This is a work in progress improvement of my previous skeletal animation system, which can be found [here](https://github.com/NuxiiGit/GML2DSkeletalAnimation).

The runtime will feature support for [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/) and [DragonBones](http://dragonbones.com). I may think about re-supporting [Spriter](https://brashmonkey.com/) in the future, but with it's successor on the horizon I may consider supporting that instead.

This is a project for Gamemaker Studio 2, and contains a diverse range of useful scripts for importing and manipulating skeletal animation structures at runtime. You are able to make use of the decentralised nature of the runtime to create and manage your own armature data without the use of external software.

## Features

This will be added when a prototype is complete.

## Installation Instructions

This will be added when an example project is complete.
